# Features

A Plain Text User Stories Parser that supports native Programming Languages.

## Usage

### Ruby on Rails

1. Install features:

		$ gem install features

2. Generate the supporting folders from your rails apps root folder:

		$ script/generate features

3. Run the HelloWorld.feature:

  * (OS X): There is a `run_features.rb` script that will open its results in Safari:

			$ ruby test/features/run_features.rb

  * (Other OS): INSTRUCTIONS WILL FOLLOW SOON ...

4. Here is what the Html Output looks like:

### Objective-C

1. Install features:

		$ sudo gem install 

2. Download and install ObjectiveMatchy

3. ObjectiveMatchy provides Xcode Project Templates that have a Feature Target. Create a new Xcode Project and choose one of the ObjectiveMatchy Templates.

## How it works

### Features parses  plain-text user story files 
That files are made up of keywords (Feature:, Scenario:)   
and step definitions (When I say 'Hello, World!'):

    Feature: Hello World

		Scenario: Say Hello World
			When I say 'Hello, World!'

### Next, a TestCase File will be generated

Each Feature (User Story) will be generated as a TestCase.   
Each Scenario as a test method.   
The step definitions provide the test method implementations.   
Regarding the above Feature, here is what the autogenerated testcases  
will look like in the different languages:

* Rails:

		require "/path/to/project/support/features_helper.rb"

		class HelloWorldTest < FeaturesTestCaseClass
		  def test_SayHelloWorld
		    when_I_say___("Hello, World!")
		  end
		end

* Objective C:

			#import "OMFeature.h"
	  
		  @interface HelloWorldTest : OMFeature
		  @end
	  
		  @implementation HelloWorldTest
		  	-(void) testSayHelloWorld
		    {
		      [self When_I_say___:@"Hello, World!"];
		    }
		  @end

* Other Languages (Java, C#, C++, Python) will follow soon ...


### Provide Step Implementations

Steps are instance method of the intermediate TestCase class (eg 'FeaturesTestCaseClass' in Rails)  
that inherits from the language specific TestCase class (eg 'ActionController::IntegrationTest' in Rails)   
and that itself is the parent of the generated TestCases. This way, all test method implementations (aka Scenarios)   
will have access to the steps.
